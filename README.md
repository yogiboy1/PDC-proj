 Some of the major 
fields in which digital image processing is widely used are image 
sharpening and restoration, medical field, remote sensing, transmission 
and encoding, machine/robot vision, color processing, pattern 
recognition, video processing, and microscopic imaging. However, the 
time and resources consumed have made it the need of the hour to 
search for a quicker and more feasible way to process the images. 
Multithreading is a model of program execution that allows for multiple 
threads to be created within a process, executing independently but 
concurrently sharing process resources. Depending on the hardware, 
threads can run fully parallel if they are distributed to their own CPU 
core. The main purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous 
execution of two or more parts of a program to maximum utilize the 
CPU time. Multi-threading has proved to be a very fast and reliable way 
to perform computations
